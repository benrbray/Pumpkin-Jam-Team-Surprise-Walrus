		<p>Far east lies an isolated forest known as the Sakoumie containing every mundane feature of a forest&mdash;trees, logs, rocks, and woodland creatures.
		<p>But one forest inhabitant makes the Sakoumie mythic; the beast known as the Demon-Wolf, who feeds in the night and then retreats to slumber at the first light of every dawn.
		<p>Then the monster to the monster arrives, humans and the following undead zombies.
		<p>These monsters are killing the Demon-Wolf's food sources and invading his home. It's time for the Demon-Wolf to fight back.
		<p>He needs to eliminate all of the monsters before daylight.
		<p><strong>The hunt is on.</strong>
